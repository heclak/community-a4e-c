    - Throttle Increment slider in the special menu is available to adjust throttle rate for Throttle Increment/Decrement inputs.
    - A Custom Throttle Rate slider in the specail menu allows you to adjust the accelleration rate for the new Custom Throttle Rate inputs. The keyboard defaults for these are RCTRL+PageUp and RCTRL+PageDown, respectively.
    - A Wheelbrake Differential axis is useful for mapping a single axis to the opposing left and right wheelbrakes.
    - Trim Speeds in the special menu are now adjustable by individually for elevator (pitch), aileron (roll), and rudder (yaw), with percentage sliders. These settings also affect the Trim Reset (Hold) speed. *(thanks Drofseh)*
    - A pair of comprehensive gamepad input presets for Xbox and PS4 controllers are included, which utilize many of the above functions. Once you are up and running in the pit, you can enjoy flying the A-4E-C with nothing but a humble gamepad and no additional software needed. *(Thanks, Tuuvas)*
  - Single inputs for the Canopy Lever. You can close the canopy with LSHIFT+C, and open it LSHIFT+LCTRL+C. *(thanks Tanuki44)*
  - Single and else inputs for Throttle Position Lock.

Some non-axis inputs associated with these have been renamed. Users with extensive control schemes should adjust their controls to resolve any conflicts. *(thanks gcask)*
  - Input for Chaff Dispenser Select - Toggle 1/2.
  - Inputs for common communications, including A/A refueling - "Ready for precontact" radio call, and Ask AWACS available tanker. *(thanks gcask)*
  - When the aircraft has power, the Seat Adjustment Switch can be used to move the baseline pilot head position up and down in the cockpit. *(thanks nima3333)*
  - Kneeboard Manual:
    - A a chart of weapon stations and their associated loadout options (page 3-7) in the kneeboard manual.
    - An overview of the included Xbox1 and PS4 gamepad layouts are available at the end of the kneeboard manual (pages 6-6 and 6-7). 
- Sounds:
  - AN/APR-25 RHWS (ECM):
    - AAA: New sounds are produced in response to the Fire Can SON-9 fire director radar.
    - Aircraft: New sounds are produced in response to aircraft search and tracking radars.
    - EWRs and Ships: Unique sound sets are produced in response to ground and ship EWRs. A new sound is also produced in response to ship tracking radars.
    - SAMs: New sounds are produced in response to the P19 "Flat Face" and S-200 ST-68U "Tin Shield" and SA-2 S-75 "Fan Song" sarch and tracking radars. Some Fan Song units will sound different, simulating the sound of different radar bands used in the field. New sounds are also produced in response to the SA-3 S-125 "Low Blow", SA-5 S-200 "Square Pair", and SA-6 Kub "Straight Flush" units. The number of different sounds a each radar produces varies by unit, so pilots will need to learn what their ears are telling them about what type SAM is targeting them, and how much launch warning that SAM provides from its PRF audio.
    - SPAAA Vehicles: New sounds are produced in response to the Gepard, Vulcan M163, and ZSU-23-4 Shilka "Gun Dish" radars.
  - Sounds are produced if the left or right wheels are skidding. Use this feedback to help you learn to taxi (as a sound you don't generally want to hear), and to avoid damaging the wheels or locking up the brakes by keeping them depressed for too long.
  - Seat adjustment hydraulic motor.

### Fixed
- Systems:
  - Setting the AN/ARN-52 TACAN mode to REC no longer crashes the client. Addressing this issue means that A-4E-C 2.0.1 is not compatible with DCS versions after 2.7.18.30765, and A-4E-C 2.1.0 and later is not be compatible with DCS versions before 2.8.0.32066.
  - AN/APG-53A Radar Terrain Clearance - PROFILE/PLAN switch input binding functions properly.
  - Input from non-axis throttle inputs now cause the APC system to disengage properly.
- Liveries:
  - Community A-4E III: Forever Free livery displays two digits on the flaps, matching the nose and tail.
- Weapons and Loadouts:
  - CBU-2B/A pod weights are calculated correctly. Weapon release and spread cause fewer collision-based self-destructs when the weapon is released.
- Quality of Life:
  - Throttle Increment and Throttle Decrement inputs function properly.
  - The trim reset input now properly adjusts the position of the Rudder Trim Switch.
  - Kneeboard Manual:
    - Waypoints on the navigation page enumerate 11 waypoints, and can't overrun the instructions on the page.
    - Placing a 300 gallon tank on the center pylon enumerates properly on the kneeboard loadout page.
    - Corrected erroneously listed procedures for ground radar.
    - Corrected erroneous procedures for air refueling.
  - VR hand positions: Users are encouraged to enable *Use Hand Controllers*, *Hand controllers use Cockpit Stick*, and *Hand Controllers use Cockpit Throttle*, and *Hand Interaction Only When Palm Grip is Obtained*. Be aware that it is easy to accidently power down the engine if you touch it with your virtual index finger while holding the grip button. Always approach the throttle with your finger above it.

- Quality of Life:
  - Default inputs for Throttle Position Lock are set to RCTRL+HOME (Step Up) and RCTRL+END (Step Down).
  - Emergency Stores Release Handle default input changed to LCTRL+J. *(think J for jettison!)*
  - Differential wheelbrake inputs default inputs are changed to LCTRL+W (left) and LALT+W (right).
  - The controls indicator's nosewheel caster indicator now displays logarithmically, making it easier to see those early changes in castering and better reflect nosewheel sensetivity to turn rate. *(thanks, Drofseh)*.
  - Refactored the special menu for easier editing in the future.
  - Kneeboard Manual:
    - Added additional guidance and notes on AN/APR-25 RHWS (ECM) operation.

## Version 2.0.1 - 5 Mar 2022

### Added

- Missions:
  - Option to disable the use of Night Vision Goggles equipment (NVG) in the mission editor.
- Liveries:
  - USN VC-10 Challengers, 1988.
- Quality of Life:
  - The A-4E-C can now be operated by many new countries. Liveries have been edited to match, Malasia to the TUDM livery, for example.
  - Several new single input (momentary) bindings, and continuous inputs for AFCS Heading Select Pull-to-Set Knob.
  - Waypoint names specified in the Mission Editor are displayed on the kneeboard. Included missions have been updated to make use of this.
  - Fuel and aircarft loadout information are displayed in the kneeboard. This page automatically updates if the aircraft is rearmed or refueled.

### Fixed
- Features:
  - Ground handling improved for greater control using differential braking (cleaned the oil out of the brake drums).
  - Improved pitch stability and more correct low speed/high aoa handling.
- Systems:
  - Altimeter updated to use more realistic realistic barometric calculations.
  - AN/APG-53A Radar AoA Compensation Switch now properly affects returns from ships. A/G mode uses the same monte carlo sampling for beam shape, taking a weighted average of intensities to determine the range.
  - APC light now turns off once the system engages *(thanks pohlinkzei)*.
  - Fuel system getting no longer gets stuck in flight refuel mode. 3-position fuel system switches default keybinds now cycle between available positions.
  - Fixed IN RANGE lamp no longer flickers when MASTER TEST pressed *(thanks nima3333)*.
- Weapons and Loadouts:
  - CBU-1/A, CBU-2/A and CBU-2B/A Cluster Dispensers now dispense an accurate number of bomblets with a minim amount of performance impact.
- Missions:
  - A-4E-C now properly represented by an `A` aircraft icon representative of the aircraft's role.
  - Unlimited fuel support in the mission editor works *(thanks nima3333)*

  - Corrected documentation URL files.

### Changed
- Systems:
  - AN/ARN-52 TACAN volume provides a better response across available knob position range.
  - CP-741/A steady gunsight position must be established to receive accurate raging information. The computer now accounts for ejection velocity improving accuracy in some regimes.
- Weapons and Loadouts:
  - Changed MK-77 napalm canisters to have a cluster effect which is much closer to actual napalm.
  - More realistic MK12 guns charging and clearance: **Guns can be armed and safed a total of 3 times before available charging nitrogen is depleted.** The gun arming and safing when these charges are dispensed is audible. The ground crew performing a rearm will replenish nitrogen charges.
  - More realistic MK4 HIPEG Gun Pods charging: Gunpods will now respond to charges only when their station is readied before engaging the gunpod switch to the CHARGE position. **Setting this switch to CLEAR clears all gunpods on the aircraft, until the ground crew rearms the aircraft.**
  - Fixed wheel brake default keybinds to a more comfortable `LCTRL+W` and `LALT+W`, to make differential braking easier for keyboard users and to be in accordance with more DCS modules. As a result, the Emergency Stores Release Handle (Jettison) has been reassigned to `LCTRL+J`.
- Quality of Life:
  - 4k- and VR-friendly asset. *(thanks Tuuvas)*
  - New mission briefing screen.

      - Manual Carrier Landing (MCL/ICLS) system and its bit test.
      - Note for TACAN and MCL/ICLS: The method used relies on the mission file. This means for a TACAN or MCL to be detected the unit (or unit with the same unit name) must exist in the mission file. Replacement objects can be spawned in to replace dead units however they must have a name which contains the original name to be correctly found by the TACAN and MCL system. This method should work 99% of the time with regular missions however if you run into trouble it is worth checking the following conditions:
        - Unit with TACAN/MCL exists in the mission file (placed in editor).
        - Equivalent unit with a name which contains the original name of the unit placed in the editor (for example UNIT3 would find a unit named UNIT3_OTHERSTUFF, if UNIT3 needed to be respawned).
        - Unit does not share a channel regardless of X or Y band.
  - AN/APG-53A Radar overhaul:
    - Radar can cast many more rays per frame.
    - Gaussian beam shape is simulated using monte carlo sampling.

    - Ships can be detected by the radar.
    - A Legacy Mode option in special menu is present allows might save users with older CPUs some performance.
  - AN/ASN-41 Navigation Computer:
    - System now integrates from starting position functioning correctly.
    - Integration happens in D1 and D2 only, set to D1 or D2 to have the correct position. Switching to STBY will pause the integration.
    - The AN/APN-153 Doppler Navigation Radar is vital to preventing drift. Minor errors are introduced for sensors producing drift over time. Average drift is about 2 - 3 nautical miles per hour. Drift will increase with heavy maneouvering.
  - AFCS and APC:
    - Re-wrote AFCS and APC for EFM integration.
    - AFCS rolls out when disabling heading mode.
    - AFCS test (cursory implementation, the indicators do not function correctly yet).
    - Stability Augmentation Switch (yaw damper).
  - Catapult Power Mode toggle for carrier launches - DEFAULT mode supports the Stennis and Supercarrier. A new mode, AUTO makes speed and mass calculations when launching from  aircraft carrier mods (for example, the HMAS Melbourne) more realistic. (Default: 'LCtrl+U').
  - Oxygen system (hypoxia is enabled).
  - Air data computer AXC-666 for AN/ASN-41 and CP-741/A, no external functionality, but this lays some ground work for more realistic simulation.
