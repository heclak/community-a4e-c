Catapult logic reworked:
	You need to rebind your "Throttle Axis"
	There are 3 new keybinds for interacting with the Catapult:
	Ready Catapult 	> Hooks you in
	Fire Catapult 	> Fires you off the ship
	Abort Catapult	> Unhooks you from the Cat
	
	Usage:
		Drive up to the Catapult and use keybind "Ready Catapult".
		you are now locked in place (no need to hold breaks).
		Spool up engine to max MIL power.
		Use keybind "Fire Catapult", to shoot you off the Deck.

	Carrier TACAN:
		After a takeoff by the Catapult, a carrier TACAN is available on channel 99.
		Notes:
			This ONLY works if you took of from the carrier.
			The carrier can't be stationary, it needs to drive at least 5knots.
			The carrier must be driving at a constant speed and heading for the entire mission
